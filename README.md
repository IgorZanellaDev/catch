# Catch (Tinder for cats)

This is a simple project I created in about 1 hour for my React Italian course on Udemy.

## What you can find inside?

### React
I used React for this project, used some hooks, component logic, etc.

### Typescript
This project is completely "covered" by types, so every component and variables use Typescript.

### Styled Components
I did the UI with Styled Components, which has been an argument of the course.
